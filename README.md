Report:

1 cooperator and 9 defector:
  We expected there to be very few or no cooperators at the end of this test. This is because 10% of the population are cooperators, so the odds that 
the only cooperator would be randomly chosen as the organism to replace are fairly low, so there is a chance there could be some cooperators, but it is unlikely. We thought that the removed cooperators would be replaced by 
defectors. We expected there to be no partial cooperators because none of the existing population are partial cooperators, so they couldn't produce 
partial cooperator offspring. This prediction was supported by our results; 100% of the population was defectors by the end of every test. We 
justify this using the same reasons we justified our predictions.

1 Cooperator and 99 Defectors
  We expected there to be very few cooperators at the end of this test, but there could still be some, since only 1% of the population is 
cooperators. This would make it less likely that that single cooperator would be randomly chosen and replaced by the reproduce method. However, the 
high proportion of defectors would cause the resulting population to be mostly defectors with only 1 cooperator. Our predictions were largely correct; 
every test resulted in populations that were primarily defectors. However, only one of those tests left us with any cooperators, which was a lower 
proportion than we expected. This makes sense because we had 100 iterations, which is plenty of chances to randomly replace the single cooperator.

9 Cooperators and 1 Defector
  We expected that there would be mostly cooperators in the resulting population, but the ratio of cooperators to defectors would be lower than the ratio 
of defectors to cooperators in our first test. This is because cooperators use energy in the update function, and defectors do not. This loss of energy
limits reproduction. After running the test, we had 3 populations which were dominated by defectors and 7 which were dominated by cooperators. This 
makes sense for the same reasons that our predictions did.

99 Cooperators and 1 Defectors
  Similar to our 1 cooperator, 99 defector test, there would be more cooperators than defectors, but there could still be some defectors
because the probability of replacing that defector is lower. This wasn't quite what happened; while we were right that there would be more 
cooperators than defectors in the resulting populations, we were wrong that there would be a few remaining defector. All of the populations were 
100% cooperators. This makes sense because we had 100 iterations, which is allows it to randomly replace the single defector.

3 Cooperators, 3 Defectors, and 4 Partial Cooperators
  Since the organism proportions of the starting population are roughly equal, we expected the resulting population to have roughly equal proportions of each 
organism. This is not what happened at all. In each test, there was one type of organism which became 100% of the population, while the others fell to 0%. This is because when an organism reproduces, the probability of replacing an organism of a type different than their own is fairly high, so they are able to dominate the population.

33 Cooperators, 33 Defectors, and 34 Partial Cooperators
Given the results of the previous test, we expected this population to do the same: have one type which reproduces until there's nothing left
of the other types. However, we expected this test to result in a slightly more even distribution of each type, since rthere is a larger population. We were correct; although there was an organism 
type which clearly outcompeted the others, it didn't manage to replace all of its competitors, and proportions were far more evenly distributed. We
understand why this happened for the same reasons that we made our predictions.
